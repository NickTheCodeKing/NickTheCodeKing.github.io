PortfolioWebsite

DESCRIPTION
- This is a portfolio website project that I started in order to showcase my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and to show my personal and course-work projects.
- My goal is to continue to improve on the website and to routinely update it with any projects I work on
